<h4>Q. How do I contribute?</h4>
<p><li><code>There is a file named FunFacts.js which has a bunch of FunFacts pre-inserted by me. They are enclosed within <strong>2 square brackets []</strong> and the texts are enclosed within <strong>double quote (" ")</strong>. You have to add your text just by enclosing then within a pair of double quotes <strong>("Your Text")</strong>. Example: "Your text",</code></li><span style="color: red">[ Note: Do not forget to separate every text by a comma , ]</span></p>
